# Custom React Hook - useApi()

## Purpose

A simple boilerplate repo for getting started with an API project. The custom useApi() hooks uses axios to fetch data and can be easily used throughout the application by importing it from the hooks folder.

## Getting Started

```shell
git clone git@github.com:xpriment626/useapi-hook-boilerplate.git [cloned_repo_name]
cd [cloned_repo_name]
```

```shell
npm install
```

## Additional Notes

The useApi hook covers the bare minimum, returning states for data, loading, and errors. Feel free to add your own logic to the useApi component for further interactions with the fetched data.
